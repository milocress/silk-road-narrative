            font-sizAs customers started to trickle into Ross's dark net market, Ross realized that for it to become the revolution he hoped it to be, he needed to create for himself a leader. The persona he created, he modeled after the movie character, the Dread Pirate Roberts, in part to add a sense of the exotic, and in part to form the basis of his legal defense â€“ in the movie The Princess Bride, the Dread Pirate Roberts was never one person, but rather a title passed on from master to worthy apprentice. What he created transended plausible deniability. The Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) created became an emblem of rebellion against the government, turned buying drugs and illicit goods from a deplorable act of desperation to an honorable declaration of freedom. This charisma was Ulbricht's greatest weapon, but the inflated ego that came with it would prove his downfall.

            The police already had the evidence they needed to trace Ulbricht to DPR and the Silk Road, but they hadn't yet made the connection. It was dumb luck that an agent assigned to investigate a small-time mushroom dealer happened across the Silk Road investigation, and drew the parallel between the user "Frosty" and the Stack Overflow article from several years before.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the authorities took down the Silk Road, they found a small snippet of code, which perfectly matched the code that was given to him in the Stack Overflow thread.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was compelling proof, but not enough to convict him. What they would need was a stronger link between Ross Ulbricht and his alter-ego, the Dread Pirate Roberts. His laptop, they knew, would be a trove for such information, yet there was a great risk that the encryption on the hard disk would mean that shutting the laptop's cover would almost certainly make any data on it irrecoverable without a master password that Ross would likely refuse to give. For several days, the growing Silk Road task force was at an impasse.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, an unexpected opportunity presented itself. Ulbricht left his home to go to the library a few blocks from where the police were stationed. Several agents entered the building after him, and set the scene for what was quite possibly the highest-stakes improv show performed. The audience was Ross Ulbricht, sitting near a window in the corner of the room, craving an escape. Escape was no longer an option.
